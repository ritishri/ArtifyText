# ArtifyText
This project is a text-to-image generation website that allows users to generate AI-powered images from text prompts using Clipdrop. Built with the MERN stack for the backend and React.js (Vite) with Tailwind CSS for the frontend, the platform provides a seamless and user-friendly experience. For payments, Razorpay is integrated, while Framer Motion enhances the UI with smooth animations.
